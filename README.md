WeakDetect is a python script that aims to allow beginners in pentester/cyber security/script kiddies to install and get the basics of using it, I hope that many young people will be interested in digital security.

## The features in the script include: 
- installation on android device( termux ).
- installation on linux device.
- basics of tool usage.
